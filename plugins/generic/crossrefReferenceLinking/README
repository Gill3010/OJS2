=== CrossrefReferenceLinking plugin
=== Version: 2.0.0
=============================================================


About
-----
This plugin will automatically add the extracted article references to the DOI registration with Crossref. Crossref will then automatically check if any DOIs can be found for the submitted references. Shortly after that, using the scheduled task, the plugin will check for the found references DOIs. If article references change once they are registered, the article DOI with the new references will have to be registered anew. Then the check for the found references DOIs will be done again.
This plugin requires Crossref DOIs to be assigned to articles, article references to be separately entered and extracted, as well as article DOIs to be deposited to Crossref from within OJS. It uses the Crossref plugin settings: Crossref credentials (username and password), as well as the setting for the testing mode.
